# Chaos Labs Utils

This package contains a contract which allow you to extand testing coverage within the aave protocol in foundry.

## Getting Started

These helpers allow you to fetch the health factor of the borrowers and validate the difference before and after the payload was executed. 


### Prerequisites

* Python - please follow the [instructions](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/) to install Python.

    - install requirements:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

## Usage with foundry
With Foundry installed and being in a Git repository:

```bash
forge install https://github.com/ChaosLabsInc/chaos-labs-utils
```

## Usage with payload test contract

### Usage example 
YourPayloadTest.Sol:
```
    import {SanityChecks} from 'chaos-labs-utils/SanityChecks.sol';
    import {TestWithExecutor} from 'aave-helpers/GovHelpers.sol';
    import {YourPayload} from '../YourPayload.sol';

    ...

    contract YourPayloadTest is TestWithExecutor, SanityChecks {

      function setUp() public {
        vm.createSelectFork(vm.rpcUrl('{chain}'), 16974783);
        _selectPayloadExecutor({{chain_executor});
      }
  
      function testPayload() public {
        uint256[] memory healthsBefore = _testBorrowrsHealth(AaveV3{chain}.POOL);

        // 2. execute payload
        _executePayload(address(new YourPayload()));

        uint256[] memory healthsAfter = _testBorrowrsHealth(AaveV3{chain}.POOL);

        validateBorrowersHealth(healthsBefore, healthsAfter, 1_00);
    }
}
```
### Functions definition

```_testBorrowrsHealth()```

this function return all borrowers health for the given protocol status.

```validateBorrowersHealth(healthsBefore, healthsAfter, changeTolerancePercentage)```

this function compares the health of the borrowed before and after the execution for a given tolerance percentage (1_00 present +-1%, for zero tolerance pass 0)

## Usage MakeFile
Recommended practice add to MakeFile:
```solidity
test-name :; python lib/chaos-labs-utils/scripts/fetch-borrowers.py {chain_name} {block_number} && forge test -vvv --match-contract YourPayloadTest
```

example for running test and fetch borrowers from the latest block update on the graph:
```
test-name :; python3 lib/chaos-labs-utils/scripts/fetch-borrowers.py ethereum && forge test -vvv --match-contract AaveEthV3PayloadTest
```

Another option - running the python script lib/chaos-labs-utils/scripts/fetch-borrowers.py before running the test:
```bash
python3 lib/chaos-labs-utils/scripts/fetch-borrowers.py {chain_name} {block_number}
```

### Script argumansts
* chain_name - The name of the chain from this supported list: ```[polygon, avalanche, arbitrum, optimism, ethereum]```
* block_number - this is an optional argument, if not pass the script withh fetch the borrowers from the latest block in the graph.

## FAQs

**Q: I got timeout error while running the python script ```requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='api.thegraph.com', port=443): Read timed out.```**

**A:** This can happen for many reasons; please try to rerun the script.


**Q: I got error while running the payload test**

**A:** This can happen because '_testBorrowrsHealth' is trying to fetch data from the node for multiple borrowers - please rerun the test.



**Q: I got requier message "Health factor changed more than the set tolerance percentage." but payload didn't changed collateral parameters**

**A:** This should not happen, we advise you to check if the payload is correct.
