# Chaos Labs Utils

This package contains a contract and utility scripts that enables extended testing coverage within the Aave protocol using Foundry.
The main usecase for this util is to provide functionality to support addtional layer of safeguards for Aave governance payloads. Scenaris where a configuration change can mistakely reduce a token's LT and cause cascading liquidations is possible and extremely risky.
To address such cases, the sanity tests that can be built with this util will help the payload writer to make sure the changes included are as designed.

## Getting Started

These tests allow you to fetch the health factor of the aave borrowers to validate the differences before and after the payload execution.

### Prerequisites

* Python - please follow the [instructions](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/) to install Python.

    - install requirements:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

## Usage with Foundry
With Foundry installed and in a Git repository:

```bash
forge install https://github.com/ChaosLabsInc/chaos-labs-utils â€”no-commit
```

## Usage with payload test contract

### Usage example 

In this example we will use `_testBorrowrsHealth` and `validateBorrowersHealth` functions to verify the payload has not unexpectedly affected the health of positions on Aave. It's useful to ensure we're not mistakely altering values we didn't intend, like reudcing some token's LT value. 

YourPayloadTest.Sol:
```
    import {SanityChecks} from 'chaos-labs-utils/SanityChecks.sol';
    import {TestWithExecutor} from 'aave-helpers/GovHelpers.sol';
    import {YourPayload} from '../YourPayload.sol';

    ...

    contract YourPayloadTest is TestWithExecutor, SanityChecks {

      function setUp() public {
        vm.createSelectFork(vm.rpcUrl('{chain}'), 16974783);
        _selectPayloadExecutor({{chain_executor});
      }
  
      function testPayload() public {
        uint256[] memory healthsBefore = _testBorrowrsHealth(AaveV3{chain}.POOL); // e.g - AaveV3Optimism.POOL

        // 2. Execute payload
        _executePayload(address(new YourPayload()));

        uint256[] memory healthsAfter = _testBorrowrsHealth(AaveV3{chain}.POOL);

        validateBorrowersHealth(healthsBefore, healthsAfter, 1_00);
    }
}
```
### Functions definition

```_testBorrowrsHealth()```

This function returns all borrowers' health for the given protocol status.

```validateBorrowersHealth(healthsBefore, healthsAfter, changeTolerancePercentage)```

This function compares the health of the borrowers before and after the execution for a given tolerance percentage (1_00 represents +-1%, for zero tolerance pass 0).


## Usage MakeFile
Recommended practice to add to Makefile:
```solidity
test-name :; python3 lib/chaos-labs-utils/scripts/fetch-borrowers.py {chain_name} {block_number} && forge test -vvv --match-contract YourPayloadTest
```

Example for running tests and fetching borrowers from the latest block update on the graph:
```
test-name :; python3 lib/chaos-labs-utils/scripts/fetch-borrowers.py ethereum 16925078 && forge test -vvv --match-contract AaveEthV3PayloadTest
```

Another option - running the Python script lib/chaos-labs-utils/scripts/fetch-borrowers.py before running the test:
```bash
python3 lib/chaos-labs-utils/scripts/fetch-borrowers.py {chain_name} {block_number}
```

### Script argumansts
* chain_name - The name of the chain from this supported list: ```[polygon, avalanche, arbitrum, optimism, ethereum]```
* block_number - this is an optional argument; if nothing is passed, the script fetches the borrowers from the latest block in the graph.

## Borrowers Fetch Logic
For each reserve(token) of the chain, we fetch the top 5 suppliers that borrowed from at least one reserver - this should assure us that their health factor is less than infinite.

## FAQs

**Q: I got a timeout error while running the Python script ```requests.exceptions.ReadTimeout: HTTPSConnectionPool(host='api.thegraph.com', port=443): Read timed out``` or ```Failed to fetch data. Status code: 524```.**

**A:** This can happen for many reasons; Mosty latency with fetching data from the graph. Rerunning the script can usually resolve it.


**Q: I got an error while running the payload test**

**A:**  First iteration can fail on latency to archive node to fetch all the balances for the test; rerunning will help.


**Q: I got the required message "Health factor changed more than the set tolerance percentage." but the payload didn't change collateral parameters**

**A:** This should not happen; we advise you to check if the payload is correct.
